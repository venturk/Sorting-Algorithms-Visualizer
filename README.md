# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

A **React app** which visualizes several **sorting algorithms**.

I have worked on this project because as a Computer Science student, I wanted to dive into the implementation of sorting algorithms. I enjoyed building this application, especially the visualization part because, well, it's cool. :-)

Check out the running app (Please use *Google Chrome*):

*There is no support for viewing the app via a phone.*
