# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

A **React app** which visualizes several **sorting algorithms**.

I've made this project because as a Computer Science student, I am fascinated by sorting algorithms and I wanted to implement them by myself. I enjoyed doing this project, especially the visualization part because, well, it's cool. :-)

*There is no support for viewing the app via a phone.*
